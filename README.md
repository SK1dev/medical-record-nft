# Smart Contracts - Blockchain Medical Record System

### How would this system work?

* A medical professional can register. Their profile is not visible to patients so their data is protected.

* Medical professionals will be able to view a list of patients that have stored their medical records (excluding any personal details).

* Medical professionals will only be allowed to view a patient's medical record if they have been given permission by the patient.

* The medical professional will be able to search for a particular record.

* Medical professionals can set up appointments for their patients.

* Medical professionals and patients can view a list of appointments and details of the appointment.

* The medical professional and the patient would both have to approve the appointment to proceed.

 * The user would have a DID (Digial Identity) set up by their government. Each citizen would have a number of DID's set up through the government, so the user would use their Medical DID for authentification on the health platform. The government would have details such as name and address so these details would not be required on this platform ensuring better anonymity.
  
* The patient will be able to search for a particular medical record.

* The patient would be allowed to view, edit and update the information in their medical record.

* The patient will be able to include any medications and keep this updated for any medical professional who has permission to be able to see.

* The patient can revoke permission for the medical professional at any time. The medical record would then no longer be visible to that medical professional/hospital.

 * An NFT can be created with the image/file being stored on IPFS. This is useful for test result, scans, x-rays etc.

### Points to consider/Recommendations:

* A patient may be unable to grant access and therefore an emergency contact would need to be able to grant permission on their behalf.

* A payment system would need to be added.

* Hyperledger Fabric would be a great platform to build this project.
